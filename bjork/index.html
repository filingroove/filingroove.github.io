		If you ever get close to a human
And human behaviour
Be ready to get confused

There's definitely no logic
To human behaviour
But yet so irristible

There's no map
To human behaviour

They're terribly moody
Then all of a sudden turn happy
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions is ever so satisfying

There's no map
And a compass
Wouldn't help at all

Human behaviour

I travel
All around the city
Go in and out of
Locomotives
All alone

There's no one here
And people everywhere


Crying 'cause I need you
Crying I can feel you
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying 'cause I care

It's a hot day
And I'm dressed lightly
I move carefully
Through the crowd

Here everyone
Is so vulnerable
And I'm aswell

There's no one here
And people everywhere


Only if a ship would sail in 
Or just someone came
And knocked at my door
Or just (or just) something

Crying 'cause I need you
Crying 'cause I need you

His wicked sense of humour
Suggests exciting sex
His fingers focus on her
Touches, he's Venus as a boy

He believes in beauty
He's Venus as a boy

He's exploring
The taste of her
Arousal
So accurate
He sets off
The beauty in her
He's Venus as a boy

Come on girl
Let's sneak out of this party
It's getting boring
There's more to life than this
It's still early morning
We could go down to the harbour
And jump between the boats
And see the sun come up

We could nick a boat
And sneak off to this island
I could bring my little ghettoblaster
There's more to life than this
But then we'd have to rush back
To the town's best baker
To get the first bread of the morning
There's more to life than this

Lately I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings
And to sing like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud
And feeling like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings
Run into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud
And feeling like someone in love
Like someone in love
Like someone in love

I can sense it
Something important
Is about to happen
It's coming up

It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big time sensuality

I don't know my future after this weekend
And I don't want to


One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all come true

One day
When you're ready
One day, one day
When you're up to it

The atmosphere
Will get lighter
And two suns ready
To shine just for you

I can feel it

One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all make sense

One day, one day
You will blossom
One day, one day
When you're ready

An aeroplane
Will curve gracefully
Around the volcano
With the eruption that never lets you down

I can feel it

And the beautifullness
Fireworks will burn
In the sky just for you

I can feel it

One day
One day

I can not live
Peacefully without you
For even a moment
I miss you terribly
When you're away

He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart

How come
Out of all the people in the world
Only one
Can make me complete
One word on the phone
Makes me happy
But one touch directly
Makes me ecstatic


Come to me
I'll take care of you
Protect you
Calm, calm down
You're exhausted
Come lie down
You don't have to explain
I understand

You know
That I adore you
You know
That I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble 
Break the charm

Jump off
Your building's on fire
I'll catch you
I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you back
And then I'll nurse you
I'll nurse you

Come to me
I'll take care of you
You don't have to explain
I understand

Since I met you
This small town hasn't got room
For my big feelings

Violently happy
'Cause I love you

Violently happy
But you're not here

Violently happy
Come calm me down
Before I get into trouble

I tip-toe down to the shore
Stand by the ocean
Make it roar at me
And I roar back

Violently happy
'Cause I love you

Violently happy
But you're not there

Violently happy
Overemotional

Violently happy
I'll get into trouble
Real soon
If you don't get here
Baby

Violently happy
'Cause I love you

Violently happy
I'm aiming too high

Violently happy
It will get me into trouble
Violently happy
I'm driving my car
Too fast
With ecstatic music on

Violently happy
I'm getting too drunk

Violently happy
I'm daring people
To jump off roofs with me

Only you
Call calm me down

I'm sitting too high

Soothe me

I live by the ocean
And during the night
I dive into it
Down to the bottom
Underneath all currents
And drop my anchor

This is where I'm staying

This is my home

Darling stop confusing me
With your wishful thinking
Hopeful embraces
Don't you understand?
I have to go through this
I belong to here where
No-one cares and no-one loves
No light no air to live in
A place called hate
The city of fear

I play dead
It stops the hurting
I play dead
And the hurting stops

It's sometimes just like sleeping
Curling up inside my private tortures
I nestle into pain
Hug suffering
Caress every ache

I play dead,
It stops the hurting
